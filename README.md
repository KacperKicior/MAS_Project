# MAS_Project
Project done for MAS course in Computer Science field of study on PJAIT

The task was to implement backend of our app from certain part of documentation and add UI features
that will provide decent user expirience. Project is based on Node.js with Express framework and
EmbededJavaScript feature, and uses Sequelize to properly implement database connections with models. 
SQLite3 is responsible for data storage.
